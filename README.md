# Motivation

The goal of this project is to find a decent neural network topology for CIFAR10 problem, that can achieve above 90% accuracy without any dataset modifications, and without extremely long (over 100 epochs) training.

No custom training loops, just pure Tensorflow Keras API out of the box.
